            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <div class="legal-content">
                <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
                <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Word Fly.</p>

                <h2>App Updates and Changes</h2>
                <p>Word Fly is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.</p>

                <h2>Data Security and Device Safety</h2>
                <p>The Word Fly app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it could mean that the Word Fly app won't work properly or at all.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google Play Services</li>
                    <li>Google Analytics for Firebase</li>
                    <li>Firebase Crashlytics</li>
                    <li>Unity</li>
                    <li>GameAnalytics</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Age Restrictions</h2>
                <p>The Services are available only to individuals who (a) are at least thirteen (13) years old, and (b) possess the legal capacity to enter into these Terms and to form a binding agreement under any applicable law, or have received the required consent from their legal guardian to enter into these Terms. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms.</p>

                <h2>Internet Connectivity and Device Compatibility</h2>
                <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Word Fly will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Word Fly cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance left.</p>

                <h2>Account Ownership and Termination</h2>
                <p>YOU AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN AN ACCOUNT, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO AN ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL BE OWNED BY WORD FLY. YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE CONSIDERED ACTIVE UNTIL WE RECEIVE YOUR REQUEST TO DEACTIVATE OR DELETE IT OR IN THE EVENT THAT WORD FLY DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY LIMIT, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE AN ACCOUNT THAT HAS BEEN INACTIVE FOR AT LEAST 365 CONSECUTIVE DAYS.</p>

                <h2>App Updates and Availability</h2>
                <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Word Fly does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.</p>

                <h2>Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>

                <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-05-25</p>
